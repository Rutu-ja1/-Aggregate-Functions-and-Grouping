## 📊 SQL Query Practice – Data Retrieval & Analysis

This module demonstrates **practical SQL queries** on the **Virtual Medical Assistant Project** database using **MySQL Workbench** or **DB Browser for SQLite**.
It combines **data extraction**, **filtering**, **sorting**, and **aggregation** to simulate real-world database analysis tasks.

### 🔹 Key Learning Areas

1. **Basic Data Retrieval**

   * Using `SELECT *` to fetch all columns.
   * Retrieving specific columns for focused results.

2. **Data Filtering**

   * Applying conditions with `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`.
   * Pattern matching using `LIKE`.
   * Range filtering with `BETWEEN`.
   * Handling `NULL` values in conditions.

3. **Sorting Data**

   * Ordering results alphabetically or numerically with `ORDER BY ASC` / `DESC`.

4. **Aggregate Functions**

   * `COUNT()` – count rows.
   * `AVG()` – average values.
   * `MIN()` / `MAX()` – smallest and largest values.
   * `SUM()` / `COUNT()` for totals.

5. **Grouping Data**

   * `GROUP BY` to summarize data by category.
   * `HAVING` to filter grouped results.

### 📁 Files Included

* **Enhanced\_SELECT\_Queries.sql** – Includes `SELECT`, filtering, and sorting queries.
* **Aggregate\_Functions\_Grouping.sql** – Aggregate and grouping queries.
* **Merged\_Queries.sql** – Combines both into a single file for ease of use.

### 🛠️ Tools Used

* MySQL Workbench
* DB Browser for SQLite

### 📌 Usage

1. Open the `.sql` file in your SQL tool.
2. Run queries sequentially to see results.
3. Modify queries for practice with different data.
